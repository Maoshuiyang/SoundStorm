## SoundStorm: Efficient Parallel Audio Generation (wip)
Unofficial Pytorch implementation of <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/soundstorm/examples/">SoundStorm</a>, a Parallel Audio Generation out of Google Research. <br>

Currently, we first provide the first version code by ourselves. We directly use a mask-based discrete diffusion to implement this, which enjoys the same process as Google's paper. For model details, please refer to our paper, InsturctTTS: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13662.pdf <br>

We will soon update the second version based on MASKGIT, which keep the same as SoundStorm.

## Overview
Following the paper, we use HuBERT to extract semantic tokens, and then using semantic token as condition to predict all of the acoustic tokens in parallel. Different with SoundStrom to use sum operation to combine the multiple codebook, we use shallow u-net to combine different codebook. For AudioCodec, we use the open source AcademiCodec https://github.com/yangdongchao/AcademiCodec

## Prepare dataset
Please refer to data_sample folder to understood how to prepare the dataset.

## Training
- Firtsly, prepare your data
- bash start/start.sh

## Inference
- Firstly, revise evaluation/generate_samples_batch.py based on your model.
- python generate_samples_batch.py
